**Instructions:**
- This plan was created during initial workflow-status setup
- Status values: Planned, Optional, Conditional, In Progress, Complete
- Current/Next steps update as you progress through the workflow
- Use this as your roadmap to know what comes after each phase

### Implementation Progress (Phase 4 Only)

**Story Tracking:** Not yet started

_Implementation tracking will activate when Phase 4 begins._

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** game (Web Game)
- **Project Level:** 1 (Small feature - 2-3 stories, 1 epic)
- **Instruction Set:** BMad Method v6
- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** Greenfield

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Level 1 web game project with UI components
- **Estimated Stories:** 2-3 stories
- **Estimated Epics:** 1 epic
- **Timeline:** TBD during planning phase

### Context

- **Existing Documentation:** None (greenfield)
- **Team Size:** TBD
- **Deployment Intent:** Web platform
- **UI Components:** Yes (UX workflow included)

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

**Phase 2 (Planning):**
- Game Design Document (GDD) for Level 1 project
- UX/UI Specification (user flows, wireframes, component specs)
- Epic and story breakdown

**Phase 4 (Implementation):**
- Story context XML files
- Implemented features per acceptance criteria
- Story completion tracking

### Workflow Sequence

1. **PM Agent:** Run `plan-project` workflow
   - Creates GDD tailored for Level 1 scope
   - Generates epic and story breakdown
   - Outputs: GDD document, epics.md, stories manifest

2. **PM Agent:** Run `ux-spec` workflow
   - Defines user flows and wireframes
   - Creates component specifications
   - Outputs: UX specification document

3. **SM Agent:** Run `create-story` workflow (iterative)
   - Drafts stories from backlog one at a time
   - User reviews and approves each story

4. **SM Agent:** Run `story-ready` workflow
   - Moves approved story to IN PROGRESS
   - Advances queue (next story to TODO)

5. **SM Agent:** Run `story-context` workflow
   - Generates context XML for current story
   - Prepares for DEV implementation

6. **DEV Agent:** Run `dev-story` workflow (iterative)
   - Implements story per acceptance criteria
   - Writes tests, validates implementation

7. **DEV Agent:** Run `story-approved` workflow
   - Marks story complete (DoD satisfied)
   - Advances queue for next story

### Next Actions

**Immediate:** Load PM agent and run `plan-project` to create your GDD

**Command:** `plan-project`

## Special Considerations

**UI-Focused Game:**
- UX workflow is included due to UI components
- Consider visual design and user experience early
- Game UI/UX may differ from traditional app UX

**Level 1 Scope:**
- Keep game mechanics simple and focused
- 2-3 stories should cover core gameplay loop
- Avoid scope creep - save advanced features for v2

**Web Platform:**
- Consider browser compatibility requirements
- Performance optimization for web delivery
- Asset loading and optimization strategies

## Technical Preferences Captured

_To be captured during planning phase._

## Story Naming Convention

### Level 1 (Coherent Feature)

- **Format:** `story-<title>-<n>.md`
- **Example:** `story-gameplay-core-1.md`, `story-gameplay-core-2.md`
- **Location:** `docs/stories/`
- **Max Stories:** 2-3 (prefer longer stories over more stories)

## Decision Log

### Planning Decisions Made

- **2025-10-16**: Project initialized as Level 1 Greenfield Web Game with UI components
- **2025-10-16**: Analysis phase skipped - proceeding directly to planning (user already knows what to build)
- **2025-10-16**: UX workflow included due to presence of UI components
- **2025-10-16**: Phase 3 (Solutioning) skipped - not required for Level 1 projects
- **2025-10-16**: Product Brief completed - Tic-Tac-Toe web game for kids with 3 AI difficulty levels. Target: children 5-12 years, MVP in 2-3 weeks
- **2025-10-16**: GDD workflow completed automatically. Comprehensive Game Design Document generated with Epic 1 (3 stories: Board & Player Moves, AI Opponent, Win Detection). Full technical architecture with React+TypeScript, AI algorithms (Easy/Medium/Hard with Minimax), component structure, development roadmap
- **2025-10-16**: Epics & Stories file created. Epic 1 broken into Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 with detailed acceptance criteria, technical notes, testing requirements. Total effort: 4-7 days dev + 2-3 days testing

## Agent Usage Guide

### For PM (Product Manager) Agent

**When to use this file:**
- Starting planning phase → Read "Project Classification" and "Planned Workflow Journey"
- After completing plan-project → Update status file with Phase 2 completion
- Before starting UX workflow → Verify plan-project is complete

**Key fields to read:**
- `project_level` → Determines GDD scope (Level 1 = focused, single epic)
- `project_type` → Game (web platform)
- `next_action` → Current recommendation (plan-project)

**Key fields to update after plan-project:**
- Phase Completion: Check [x] 2-Plan
- Current Phase: Update to "2-Plan (UX)"
- Current Workflow: "ux-spec"
- Progress: Update to 30%
- Artifacts: Add GDD and epics.md entries
- Next Action: Run ux-spec workflow

### For SM (Scrum Master) Agent

**When to use this file:**
- Starting Phase 4 → Read epic/story breakdown to populate BACKLOG
- Running `create-story` → Read TODO section for story to draft
- Running `story-ready` → Update status file (TODO → IN PROGRESS, BACKLOG → TODO)

**Implementation tracking activates in Phase 4.**

### For DEV (Developer) Agent

**When to use this file:**
- Running `dev-story` → Read IN PROGRESS section for current story
- Running `story-approved` → Update status file (IN PROGRESS → DONE, advance queue)

**Implementation tracking activates in Phase 4.**
