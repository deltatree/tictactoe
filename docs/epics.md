### Story 1.2: AI Opponent & Difficulty Levels

**Story ID:** STORY-1.2
**Story Title:** AI Opponent & Difficulty Levels
**Epic:** EPIC-1
**Priority:** High (Must Have)
**Complexity:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

**User Story:**
```
As a child player
I want to play against a computer opponent with adjustable difficulty
So that I can challenge myself as I improve
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

‚úÖ **AC1: AI Response**
- [ ] After player places X, AI automatically places O in a valid empty cell
- [ ] AI response is immediate (< 50ms calculation time)
- [ ] O symbol appears in red (#EF4444)
- [ ] Turn switches back to player after AI move

‚úÖ **AC2: Difficulty Selection**

- [ ] User can select difficulty before starting a game
- [ ] Selected difficulty is visually highlighted
- [ ] Difficulty cannot be changed during an active game
- [ ] New game resets to allow difficulty change

‚úÖ **AC3: Easy Mode (Semi-Random AI)**
- [ ] AI makes 70% random moves, 30% strategic moves
- [ ] Strategic moves: 50% chance to take winning move if available
- [ ] Strategic moves: 50% chance to block player winning move
- [ ] Player win rate in testing: 30-40%
- [ ] AI feels beatable but not trivial

‚úÖ **AC4: Medium Mode (Heuristic AI)**
- [ ] AI always takes winning move if available (100%)

- [ ] AI never loses (perfect play)
- [ ] Best possible outcome for player: draw
- [ ] Algorithm completes in < 50ms on target devices
- [ ] Player win rate: 0% (draws acceptable)

‚úÖ **AC6: Performance**
- [ ] All AI calculations complete in < 50ms
- [ ] No UI freezing or lag during AI turn
- [ ] Smooth transition between player and AI turns

**Technical Notes:**
- Implement three separate AI strategy functions
- Easy: weighted random + conditional logic
- Medium: rule-based heuristics (win ‚Üí block ‚Üí center ‚Üí corner ‚Üí edge)
- Hard: recursive minimax with alpha-beta pruning (optional optimization)
- AI logic in separate `aiPlayer.ts` module for testability

**AI Algorithm Pseudocode (Hard Mode):**
```typescript
function minimax(board, depth, isMaximizing):
  if gameOver:
    return score (10 for AI win, -10 for player win, 0 for draw)
  
  if isMaximizing:
    bestScore = -infinity
    for each empty cell:
      place O, recurse with isMaximizing=false, undo move
      bestScore = max(bestScore, recursion result)
    return bestScore
  else:
    bestScore = infinity
    for each empty cell:
      place X, recurse with isMaximizing=true, undo move
      bestScore = min(bestScore, recursion result)
    return bestScore
```

**Dependencies:**

### Story 1.3: Win Detection & Game Flow

**Story ID:** STORY-1.3
**Story Title:** Win Detection & Game Flow
**Epic:** EPIC-1
**Priority:** High (Must Have)
**Complexity:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days

**User Story:**
```
As a child player
I want the game to automatically detect when someone wins or the game is a draw
So that I know the result and can start a new game
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

‚úÖ **AC1: Win Detection**
- [ ] Game correctly detects all 8 winning patterns:
  - 3 horizontal rows: [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8]
  - 3 vertical columns: [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8]
  - 2 diagonals: [0,4,8], [2,4,6]
- [ ] Win detection triggers immediately after winning move
- [ ] No false positives (non-winning states reported as wins)
- [ ] No false negatives (actual wins missed)

‚úÖ **AC2: Draw Detection**
- [ ] Game correctly detects draw when all 9 cells filled with no winner
- [ ] Draw detection only triggers when board is completely full
- [ ] Draw message displays clearly

‚úÖ **AC3: Win Animation**
- [ ] Winning line is highlighted/animated across winning cells
- [ ] Line color: Golden Yellow (#FBBF24)
- [ ] Animation duration: ~500ms
- [ ] Line draws smoothly from first to last cell in pattern

‚úÖ **AC4: Game Status Display**
- [ ] Status text updates correctly at each stage:
  - Before game start: "W√§hle deinen Schwierigkeitsgrad"
  - Player turn: "Du bist dran! (X)"
  - AI turn: "Computer ist dran..." (if delay enabled)
  - Player wins: "Du hast gewonnen! üéâ"
  - AI wins: "Computer hat gewonnen!"
  - Draw: "Unentschieden!"
- [ ] Text is large, clear, and easy to read (24px+ font size)

‚úÖ **AC5: New Game Flow**
- [ ] "Neues Spiel" button is always visible and accessible
- [ ] Clicking "Neues Spiel" clears the board completely
- [ ] New game resets all state (board, turn, status, winner)
- [ ] Difficulty selection remains available after game end
- [ ] Smooth transition when starting new game (200ms fade)

‚úÖ **AC6: Game Over State**
- [ ] After win/draw, board becomes non-interactive (can't click cells)
- [ ] Result message displays prominently
- [ ] Optional: Subtle celebration animation on player win (confetti/sparkles)
- [ ] "Neues Spiel" button is emphasized after game ends

‚úÖ **AC7: No Bugs or Edge Cases**
- [ ] Game never crashes during play
- [ ] No infinite loops or freezes
- [ ] State transitions are always correct
- [ ] Rapid clicking doesn't break game logic
- [ ] Browser refresh doesn't cause errors

**Technical Notes:**
- Win detection function checks all 8 patterns after each move
- Store winning line coordinates for animation
- Use React state to manage game status
- Animation via CSS transitions or SVG line drawing
- Prevent cell clicks when game is over (gameStatus !== 'playing')

**Win Detection Algorithm:**
```typescript
function checkWinner(board: Cell[]): {
  winner: 'X' | 'O' | 'draw' | null,
  line: number[] | null
} {
  const patterns = [
    [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8], // rows
    [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8], // columns
    [0,4,8], [2,4,6] // diagonals
  ];
  
  for (pattern of patterns) {
    const [a, b, c] = pattern;
    if (board[a] && board[a] === board[b] && board[a] === board[c]) {
      return { winner: board[a], line: pattern };
    }
  }
  
  if (board.every(cell => cell !== null)) {
    return { winner: 'draw', line: null };
  }
  
  return { winner: null, line: null };
}
```

**Dependencies:**
- Story 1.1 (board must work)
- Story 1.2 (AI must work)

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for all 8 win patterns (X wins and O wins)
- Unit test for draw detection
- Unit test for "no winner yet" state
- E2E tests for complete game flows:
  - Player wins on each of the 8 patterns
  - AI wins
  - Draw game
- Visual testing for win animation
- Edge case testing (rapid clicks, mid-game refresh)

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Code complete and peer-reviewed
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests for win/draw detection (100% coverage)
- [ ] E2E tests for all game outcome scenarios
- [ ] Animation tested on all target browsers

1. **AI Performance on Low-End Devices**
   - Risk: Minimax too slow on old phones
   - Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize if needed, fallback to heuristic if < 50ms

2. **Browser Quirks**
   - Risk: Safari or mobile browser bugs
   - Mitigation: Cross-browser testing on real devices, progressive enhancement

### Scope Risks
3. **Feature Creep**
   - Risk: Adding "just one more thing" delays MVP
   - Mitigation: Strict adherence to Epic 1 scope, move extras to Phase 2

### UX Risks
4. **Difficulty Balancing**
   - Risk: Easy too hard, Hard too frustrating
   - Mitigation: Playtest with 5-10 kids, adjust AI weights as needed

## Success Metrics (Post-Launch)

**Within 30 Days of MVP Launch:**
- 1,000+ unique visitors
- 50+ daily active users
- Average 5+ games per session
- 95%+ game completion rate
- 40% return rate (7-day)
- < 5% bounce rate
- Load time < 2s (95th percentile)

## Notes & Assumptions

**Assumptions:**
- Players have modern browsers (no IE11 support)
- Players have stable internet for initial load (after that, game is client-side)
- Children know basic Tic-Tac-Toe rules or learn them intuitively
- Touch devices are primary platform (60%+ mobile/tablet usage expected)

**Out of Scope for Epic 1:**
- User accounts or login
- Persistent statistics across sessions
- Online multiplayer (real-time between users)
- Backend or database
- Monetization or ads
- Complex tutorials or onboarding

**Document Status:** Ready for Development
**Next Step:** Begin Story 1.1 implementation
**Story Files Location:** `docs/stories/` (to be created)
